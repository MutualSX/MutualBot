# Mutual

*Mutual is a multipurpose Discord bot designed to fit any user's needs.*

# To Do
- Switch database, planning to use Mongo because I dislike MySQL (Currently using Quick.db which sucks)

- Add more commands (Bot is still in development though)

# Invite the bot

The bot isn't currently public because there is few commands and features (but they are actively being worked on)

Self-hosting is not recommended because many bugs may occurr, however if you know what you are doing feel free. :)
